How's it going?  
Long time no see.  
What’s up?  
How have you been?  
I appreciate it.  
I owe you one.  
That sounds great.  
I can’t agree more.  
Let’s get started.  
Let’s keep in touch.  
Take your time.  
I didn't catch that.  
Could you repeat that?  
What do you think?  
That makes sense.  
It’s up to you.  
No worries.  
Keep it up!  
You nailed it!  
Don’t be afraid.  
I’m on my way.  
It’s a piece of cake.  
Out of the blue.  
Let’s call it a day.  
The ball is in your court.  
A blessing in disguise.  
Actions speak louder than words.  
Better late than never.  
Break a leg!  
Hit the sack.  
Let the cat out of the bag.  
Spill the beans.  
Under the weather.  
Cost an arm and a leg.  
Once in a blue moon.  
A penny for your thoughts.  
All ears.  
Back to square one.  
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.  
Go the extra mile.  
Bite the bullet.  
Burn the midnight oil.  
Cry over spilled milk.  
Every cloud has a silver lining.  
Fish out of water.  
Give someone the cold shoulder.  
Hit the nail on the head.  
Jump on the bandwagon.  
Kill two birds with one stone.  
Let sleeping dogs lie.  
Miss the boat.  
No pain, no gain.  
On the ball.  
Pull yourself together.  
See eye to eye.  
The last straw.  
Through thick and thin.  
Turn a blind eye.  
Your guess is as good as mine.  
Barking up the wrong tree.  
Burn bridges.  
Cut to the chase.  
Get cold feet.  
Go with the flow.  
Leave no stone unturned.  
Make ends meet.  
Play devil’s advocate.  
Throw in the towel.  
Up in the air.  
Think outside the box.  
A dime a dozen.  
Break the ice.  
Call it a day.  
Jump the gun.  
Let bygones be bygones.  
Rain on someone’s parade.  
Read between the lines.  
Shoot for the stars.  
Sit tight.  
The elephant in the room.  
Under the table.  
Walk on eggshells.  
Go the extra mile.  
Haste makes waste.  
Hit rock bottom.  
Jump to conclusions.  
Kick the bucket.  
Like a fish out of water.  
Not my cup of tea.  
Pull someone’s leg.  
Put all your eggs in one basket.  
Ride the wave.  
Rock the boat.  
Save face.  
Steal someone’s thunder.  
The early bird catches the worm.  
Throw caution to the wind.  
Turn over a new leaf.  
Water under the bridge.  
When pigs fly.  
Wrap your head around something.  
You can’t judge a book by its cover.  
Between a rock and a hard place.  
Burst your bubble.  
Cut corners.  
Don’t cry over spilled milk.  
Fit as a fiddle.  
Grasp at straws.  
Hitch your wagon to a star.  
If the shoe fits, wear it.  
It takes two to tango.  
Let sleeping dogs lie.  
Off the beaten path.  
Open a can of worms.  
Raining cats and dogs.  
Skating on thin ice.  
The ball is in your court.  
Through thick and thin.  
Throw in the towel.  
Under one’s belt.  
Walk a mile in someone’s shoes.  
Zip your lip.  
At the drop of a hat.  
Be in hot water.  
Cross that bridge when you come to it.  
Cut the mustard.  
Face the music.  
Fly off the handle.  
Get something off your chest.  
Hit the books.  
Keep your chin up.  
Let your hair down.  
Make a long story short.  
On cloud nine.  
Out of the frying pan into the fire.  
Pull out all the stops.  
Put your foot down.  
Sleep on it.  
Spill the beans.  
Stick to your guns.  
The ball is in your court.  
Throw someone under the bus.  
Turn a deaf ear.  
When it rains, it pours.  
Without a hitch.  
Word of mouth.  
You reap what you sow.  
Beat around the bush.  
Birds of a feather flock together.  
By the skin of your teeth.  
Cry wolf.  
Every dog has its day.  
Get your act together.  
Give someone a taste of their own medicine.  
Go back to the drawing board.  
Have bigger fish to fry.  
Keep your nose to the grindstone.  
Kill time.  
Leave no stone unturned.  
Let the cat out of the bag.  
Make hay while the sun shines.  
Mum’s the word.  
Not a big deal.  
Out of sight, out of mind.  
Put the cart before the horse.  
Reinvent the wheel.  
Rome wasn’t built in a day.  
See which way the wind blows.  
Speak of the devil.  
The grass is always greener on the other side.  
Time flies when you’re having fun.  
We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.  
You can’t have your cake and eat it too.  
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  
A watched pot never boils.  
Actions speak louder than words.  
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.  
Curiosity killed the cat.  
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.  
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.  
Honesty is the best policy.  
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.  
It’s a small world.  
Look before you leap.  
Make a mountain out of a molehill.  
Misery loves company.  
No news is good news.  
Practice makes perfect.  
Strike while the iron is hot.  
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.  
The proof is in the pudding.  
Two wrongs don’t make a right.  
What goes around comes around.  
You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.  
Don’t bite off more than you can chew.  
Great minds think alike.  
Live and learn.  
The early bird gets the worm.  
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.  
All good things must come to an end.  
Bite the bullet.  
Birds of a feather flock together.  
Cut your losses.  
Don’t judge a book by its cover.  
Every rose has its thorn.  
Fake it till you make it.  
Finders keepers, losers weepers.  
Fortune favors the bold.  
Hindsight is 20/20.  
Ignorance is bliss.  
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  
Let bygones be bygones.  
Love is blind.  
No pain, no gain.  
Out of the frying pan into the fire.  
Patience is a virtue.  
Silence is golden.  
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.  
The pen is mightier than the sword.  
There's no place like home.  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  
You can't please everyone.
